// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of 
    each variable to a definition of the step. The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = `
This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. 
Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.`;

const requirements = `
Next the development team will evaluate what will be needed to implement the planned features. The team will look at 
feasability and research technical specifications for the desired features.
`;

const design = `
The design phase is concerned with mocking out the components like the UI and database that the project requires.
`;

const testingAndIntegration = `
Testing and integration is then performed to ensure that all the features are working as intended. Bugs are fixed in this
stage.
`;

const implementation = `
After testing, different parts of the project will be merged into production which means the project should be ready for delivery.
`;

const maintain = `
After the product has been delivered, it must still be maintained. New features or enhanced features might be added. Users
might report bugs. The database might need to be scaled or optimized as the number of users increase. This is an ongoing
process.
