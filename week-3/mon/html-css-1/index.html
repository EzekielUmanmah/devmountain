      <h1>The Winds of Winter</h1>
      <p>
        The <em><strong>Winds of Winter</strong></em> is the planned sixth novel
        in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by American writer
        George R. R. Martin. Martin believes the last two volumes of the series
        will total over 3,000 manuscript pages. Martin has refrained from making
        hard estimates for the final release date of the novel after several
        delays. He is still writing the manuscript as of 2022, having stated in
        October of that year that he had written approximately three-quarters of
        it.

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            The Winds of Winter will take readers farther north than any of the
            previous books, and the Others will appear in the book. The previous
            installment, A Dance with Dragons, covered less story than Martin
            intended, excluding at least one planned large battle sequence and
            leaving several character threads ending in cliffhangers. Martin
            intends to resolve these storylines "very early" in The Winds of
            Winter, saying "I'm going to open with the two big battles that I
            was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle at Meereen
            â€” the battle of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there." A
            Victarion Greyjoy chapter will begin five minutes after the end of A
            Dance with Dragons, taking place on the eve of the Ironborn's
            arrival in Slaver's Bay. Arianne Martell sample chapters that Martin
            released on his website showed her heading for Griffin's Roost to
            see the young man who is calling himself Aegon Targaryen. At
            Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016, Martin gave some clues
            about the dark nature of The Winds of Winter: ... "I've been telling
            you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when
            things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is
            not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for.
            Some of the characters [are] in very dark places. .... Things get
            worse before they get better, so things are getting worse for a lot
            of people."
          </p>
          <h2>Viewpoint characters</h2>
          <p>
            Martin has confirmed that the following characters have
            point-of-view chapters in The Winds of Winter: Sansa Stark: One
            chapter was removed from A Dance with Dragons in June 2010,[6] and
            one sample chapter titled Alayne appeared on Martin's website in
            April 2015.[7] Arya Stark: One chapter was removed from A Dance with
            Dragons in June 2010,[6] and one sample chapter titled Mercy
            appeared on Martin's website in March 2014.[8][9] Arianne Martell:
            Two chapters were removed from A Dance with Dragons in June 2010.[6]
            One sample chapter appeared on Martin's website in January 2013,[4]
            and was read at Harbour Front Literaturfestival in June 2015.[10]
            Martin read from both chapters at MystiCon in February 2016.[11] In
            May 2016, Martin replaced the sample Sansa Stark chapter titled
            Alayne on his website from 2015 with the first Arianne Martell
            chapter he has read from at MystiCon.[12] Aeron Greyjoy: One chapter
            was removed from A Dance with Dragons in July 2010.[13] A chapter
            titled The Forsaken was read in May 2016 at Balticon. It was written
            in, or before, 2011 but there was no confirmation that this was the
            chapter removed from A Dance with Dragons.[14] Theon Greyjoy: One
            sample chapter appeared on Martin's website in December
            2011.[15][16] It also appears as a teaser chapter at the end of the
            UK paperback edition of A Dance with Dragons (part two).[citation
            needed] Victarion Greyjoy: Portions of one chapter were first read
            at TIFF Bell Lightbox in March 2012.[3] Tyrion Lannister: One
            chapter was read at Eastercon in April 2012,[17] and another one at
            Worldcon in August 2013,[18] the second of which was later published
            in the official iOS app on March 20, 2014.[19] Barristan Selmy: One
            chapter was released as a teaser at the end of the 2013 U.S.
            paperback edition of A Dance with Dragons.[20] In 2013, Martin read
            from a second chapter at Boskone.[21] Cersei Lannister[22] Jaime
            Lannister[22] Brienne of Tarth[22] Areo Hotah[23] Jon Connington[23]
            Bran Stark[24] Martin confirmed that there are no new viewpoint
            characters intended for The Winds of Winter.[25] He also stated that
            Samwell Tarly and Asha Greyjoy will appear in the novel, but did not
            elaborate if as viewpoint characters.[23][22][26][27][28] He has
            also stated that non-viewpoint characters Lady Stoneheart, Quaithe,
            Euron Greyjoy and Rickon Stark will appear.[23] He stated that
            Melisandre will return as viewpoint but did not state which novel
            her chapters will appear in.[29] He teased at the 2014 San Diego
            Comic-Con that Jeyne Westerling, Robb Stark's widow, will appear in
            the prologue chapter, but did not reveal who will be the POV
            character.[30]

          <h2>Background and publication</h2>
          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <p>
            The Winds of Winter[6] was originally intended, in the very early
            stages of the series, to be the final installment of A Song of Ice
            and Fire (then conceived as a trilogy).[31] Following his expansion
            of the series, Martin eventually concluded it would be succeeded by
            one final novel, A Dream of Spring.[32] Martin believes the last two
            volumes of the series will be massive works of more than 1,500
            manuscript pages each.[33][34] He does not intend to separate
            characters by geography again, as he was forced to do with A Feast
            for Crows because of the unpublishable length of that novel's
            original manuscript. But, as he stated in a 2011 interview, "Three
            years from now when I'm sitting on 1,800 pages of manuscript with no
            end in sight, who the hell knows".[35] In 2018, he revealed that
            some of his publishers had suggested splitting The Winds of Winter
            into two books but that he was "resisting that notion".[36] In 2022,
            he stated that The Winds of Winter could be bigger than A Storm of
            Swords or A Dance with Dragons;[37] A Storm of Swords had 1521
            manuscript pages[38] and the manuscript A Dance with Dragons
            exceeded 1,600 pages before trimming.[39]
          </p>
          <h3>Chapters</h3>
          <p>
            By June 2010, Martin had finished four chapters for The Winds of
            Winter from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, and Arianne
            Martell.[6] In July 2010, he added an Aeron Greyjoy chapter that had
            been moved from A Dance with Dragons to The Winds of Winter,
            accumulating around 100 completed manuscript pages.[13] Following
            the publication of A Dance with Dragons in July 2011, Martin
            announced his return to writing the series in January 2012,[2]
            having spent the intervening time on his U.S. and overseas book
            publicity tours and attending various conventions.[40] In December
            2011, Martin posted a Theon Greyjoy viewpoint chapter from The Winds
            of Winter; he also announced that another sample chapter would be
            included at the end of the North American paperback version of A
            Dance with Dragons,[1][41] which was originally expected to be
            released in mid-2012,[1] but was released on October 29, 2013.[42]
            (International paperback editions of A Dance with Dragons published
            a year earlier did not include a new, as yet unpublished sample
            chapter.)[43] In the first quarter of 2012, Martin read new chapters
            of other characters at public events, including the chapters of
            Victarion Greyjoy and Tyrion Lannister.[17] Martin continued work
            editing anthologies and completing a large, highly detailed series
            atlas The Lands of Ice and Fire, which was published in October
            2012.[44][45] Martin published another sample chapter from Arianne
            Martell's POV on his website in January 2013.[4] On March 27, ten
            days before the Game of Thrones season four premiere, Martin posted
            a chapter on his website, titled Mercy. Martin said the new chapter
            is actually an old one, though never published nor publicly read.[8]
            In April 2015, Martin posted a Sansa Stark viewpoint chapter from
            The Winds of Winter titled Alayne.[7] In May 2016, Martin replaced
            this chapter with an Arianne Martell chapter he had read from at
            Mysticon,[12] and an Aeron Greyjoy chapter that was removed from A
            Dance with Dragons was read at Balticon. As of June 2016, a total of
            11 chapters from The Winds of Winter had been either read publicly
            or published as a sample chapter. The point of view characters with
            released material are Victarion, Aeron, Tyrion, Barristan, Arianne,
            Theon, Mercy (Arya), and Alayne (Sansa).[46] Several websites,
            including Goodreads, have dedicated entire discussion panels to any
            material that has been released from The Winds of Winter, including
            plot twists, theories, and speculations. In 2018, Martin indicated
            he would not release any more sample chapters.[47] In 2020, Martin
            indicated he had been revising some of the sample chapters.[48]

          <h3>Writing history</h3>
          <p>
            In April 2011, shortly before the publication of A Dance with
            Dragons, which took him six years to write, Martin hoped that "the
            last two books will go a little quicker than this one has" and
            estimated that it would take "three years to finish the next one at
            a good pace".[49][50] By October 2012, 400 pages of the sixth novel
            had been written, although Martin considered only the first 200 as
            "really finished", the rest still needing revisions.[51] In April
            2013, Martin estimated that he had a quarter of the book.[52] In the
            past, Martin has angered some of his fan base for repeatedly
            estimating his publication dates too optimistically; therefore, he
            has refrained from making hard estimates for The Winds of Winter's
            final release date.[2] In April 2015, Martin said he would like to
            have it published before the sixth season of the HBO series Game of
            Thrones (which was to cover material from the book) aired in
            2016;[53][54] in September 2015, statements made by the Spanish
            editor and the Polish translator of the novel indicated that it was
            expected to be published in 2016.[55][56][57][58] In January 2016,
            Martin confirmed that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he
            had established with his publisher for release of the book before
            the sixth season of the HBO show. He added that completion of the
            book was "months away still... if the writing goes well". Martin
            also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015
            that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September
            2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He
            confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed on the
            show Game of Thrones[59] but one of the showrunners, David Benioff,
            claimed that while certain key elements would be the same, the show
            would diverge from the book in many respects.[60] In February 2016,
            Martin stated that he had dropped all his editing projects except
            for Wild Cards, and that he would not be writing anything before
            delivering The Winds of Winter.[61] In 2017, Martin believed that
            The Winds of Winter would be released that same year. However, he
            also noted that he had believed the same thing would occur the
            previous year,[46][62][63] and later that year he confirmed he was
            "still months away" from finishing the book, indicating it may not
            be published until 2018 or later, with Fire & Blood, the book on the
            history of House Targaryen, possibly preceding it.[64] In April
            2018, Martin confirmed that Fire & Blood would be published before
            The Winds of Winter, which would not be published in 2018;[65] he
            indicated that Fire & Blood was the book his publisher wanted
            next.[66] Since then, he has confirmed at least four times in 2018
            that he was continuing work on The Winds of Winter.[67][68][69][70]
            In April 2019, Martin said that the writing "has been going very
            well lately",[71] and in May he wrote that if he did not have a copy
            of The Winds of Winter in hand for 2020 Worldcon New Zealand, Air
            New Zealand has his permission to imprison him on New Zealand's
            White Island until he finishes it.[72][73] In October 2019, Martin
            said he hoped to finish The Winds of Winter "in the relatively near
            future",[74] and after a Game of Thrones prequel, House of the
            Dragon, of which Martin is one of the executive producers, was
            announced,[75] he stated that there was a lot of work to be done on
            the series but that he would not write any scripts for the series
            before finishing The Winds of Winter.[76] In an interview published
            in January 2020, Martin said that while he was still working on The
            Winds of Winter, his primary focus, he also continues[77] working
            with Nnedi Okorafor on a TV adaptation of her science fantasy novel
            Who Fears Death,[78] for which he agreed to be executive producer in
            2017.[79] In March and April 2020, Martin stated that he was writing
            The Winds of Winter every day.[80][81] In February 2021, Martin said
            he had written "hundreds and hundreds of pages" of The Winds of
            Winter in 2020 but that even though it had been the most productive
            year with regard to The Winds of Winter, he still had hundreds of
            pages to write; although he was hopeful of finishing in 2021, he did
            not want to make any predictions.[82] In March 2022, Martin stated
            that he had made less progress in 2021 than in 2020, but emphasized
            that "'less' is not 'none'".[83] During an appearance on the October
            25, 2022, episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Martin said
            that approximately three quarters of The Winds of Winter had been
            written.[84][85]
